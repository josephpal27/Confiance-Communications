                            <p>Choosing to collaborate with Confiance was driven by Bushraâs profound insight into the sentiments of Indian consumers regarding international travel. I take great satisfaction in recognizing them as an exemplary partner for the India campaign of TÃ¼rkiye Tourism. Throughout our association, Confiance has consistently provided valuable strategic inputs and leveraged relationships to establish robust awareness around TÃ¼rkiyeâs locations as premier travel, leisure, and wedding destinations. I anticipate many more years of a fruitful partnership with Confiance, relying on their expertise as our strategic communication advisor for India.</p>

We got a lot of intelligent insights into how to position ourselves and how to turn our updates into PR-worthy articles. The team consistently over-delivered on its targets. Bushra is an extremely energetic founder and has been involved throughout the journey. This was very important for us as the person who pitched to us and who oversaw operations was the same. The team has a great network and bond with the journalists and is quite perseverant. Overall, it was a great experience working with Confiance and I have recommended the company to a lot of my friends. I just wish they had a referral bonus.</p>

                            <p>As Co-founder & COO at Sunstone, our partnership with Bushra and the Confiance team has been truly delightful. Their pivotal role in Sunstoneâs brand development during its early stages, especially in spearheading our national and regional communications strategy, significantly contributed to our brandâs growing nationwide presence. Their expertise and strategic insights were evident in their campaign suggestions, which played a key role in efficiently amplifying our vision among the right audience.

                            <p>At Bigsmall.in , we collaborated with Confiance for the past 4-5 months. Public relations are extremely important for any brand to truly blossom â any great idea needs execution, and a major part of the execution is to convey the right messages to the clientele. The right PR person helps doing just that â showcasing the brand in the right way, and Conficnace did not only just that â but much more. They truly understood the ethos of our brand, what our philosophy was and what, as a brand, we wanted to stand out for, and convey to the audience. They were always asking the right questions and bringing in fresh and creative ideas from their end. Bushra was also always ready to have brainstorming sessions to aid us, and bring out better execution from our ideas, and to contribute her own. She was extremely dedicated to highlighting the brandâs presence, just the way we had envisioned it to be. It was certainly a great pleasure working with them.</p>

There is no barrier they cannot overcome and there is no effort they are unwilling to attempt. High ownership and very adaptable.</p>

Particularly the work that they have done for our company being that I am from the USA, they did a great job in bringing my story to the media and publications here in terms of the brand visibility and the journey I have carried and why I decided to come into the real estate industry. Their team members are fantastic and she is a great symbol of hiring people with great talent and I see a lot of women also in her company. I wish them the best and I feel they are a bang on company if you want your PR activities and brand engagement done!</p>

When we started out, our sector was relatively less talked about. Confiance has been instrumental in evoking active discussions about our industry and helping VAMA claim its thought leadership in these conversations. Bushra and her team feel like a natural extension of our own, given their close involvement in VAMA as a growing faith tech platform.</p>
